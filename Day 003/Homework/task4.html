Σαν σήμερα: Το Mariner 9 φτάνει στον Άρη  Fourth planet from the Sun <br>
Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is known for its reddish appearance due to iron oxide on its surface. It is a cold, <br> dry planet that was once warmer and wetter, with evidence suggesting it had a thicker  <br>atmosphere capable of supporting flowing water billions <br> of years ago. Mars is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which is about 21 km high, and has <br> two moons, Phobos and Deimos. It has been extensively explored by various missions, <br> including rovers that have provided valuable data about its geology and climate. NASA+3</p>
