Wikipedia Asian Month 2025

Wikipedia Asian Month is an annual Wikipedia contest focused on the promotion of Asian content on various language-specific Wikipedias. Each participating community runs a month-long online edit-a-thon every November on their language's Wikipedia to create new content or improve existing articles about Asian topics apart from their own country. Participation is not limited to Asian communities.

The first iteration of this competition began in 2015 and each year the number of articles has increased, and the participants have diversified and expanded. In the past seven years, over 56,265 high-quality articles have been added in more than 64 language-specific Wikipedias by more than 5,400 Wikipedia editors.

As part of the friendship and cultural exchange of the Wikipedia Asian Community, participants who create at least four articles will receive a special Wikipedia Postcard from another participating community.

Get ready to be surprised! You never know which Wiki community will be sending you postcards! Wikipedians who create the most articles on each Wikipedia will be honored with the "Wikipedia Asian Month Golden Award".

In a nutshell: Create new articles relating to Asia (people, places, culture, etc.), 3,000 bytes and 300 words minimum, with sources, during November 2025. Lists do not qualify.

The article is newly created by you (i.e. not expanding stubs) between November 1, 2025, at 0:00 and November 30, 2025, at 23:59 (UTC).
The article should be at least 3,000 bytes and at least 300 words in length. (excluding infobox, templates, etc.)
The article must fulfill the notability criteria.
The article must have decent references; doubtful or controversial statements in the article should be verifiable by the citation(s) listed in that article.
The article must not be purely machine-translated and should be properly copy-edited.
There must be no major issues with the article (no copyright violations, questions of notability, etc.)
Editors who submit multiple instances of copyright violations may be disqualified from winning the ambassador title.
The article should not be a list.
Exception: Creating a list that becomes a featured list counts. (Only applies in Wikipedias that have featured lists.)
The article should be informative.
The article should be about any topic concerning an Asian country.
Articles submitted by an organizer need to be checked by other organizers.
Judge(s) from each language Wikipedia will determine whether an article is accepted or not for their language Wikipedia's contest.

Focus theme
Asia is a very large region! It has the largest land area in the world, as well as maritime space in which many islands are located. It is not easy to understand the rich diversity of the natural and cultural aspects of this huge area. For Wikipedia Asian Month, we hope to select a focus theme for each year's campaign and encourage participants to get to know more about one aspect of this area. Please join and propose the theme you wish to introduce to the world the most!
